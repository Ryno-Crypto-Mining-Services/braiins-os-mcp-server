## Session 2 Activities (2025-12-30 - Context Standardization)

### Context Interface Refactoring

**Objective:** Standardize MCP context interfaces to eliminate inconsistencies and redundant types

**Implementation Steps:**
1. ✅ Created BaseContext interface in `src/mcp/tools/types.ts`
   - Defined shared interface with all 3 services (minerService, braiinsClient, jobService)
   
2. ✅ Updated ResourceContext to extend BaseContext
   - File: `src/mcp/resources/types.ts`
   - Added jobService to ResourceContext via inheritance
   
3. ✅ Updated PromptContext to extend BaseContext
   - File: `src/mcp/prompts/types.ts`
   - Added jobService to PromptContext via inheritance
   
4. ✅ Removed redundant JobToolContext
   - File: `src/mcp/tools/check-job-status.ts`
   - Eliminated 15 lines of redundant type definition
   - Removed defensive runtime checks for jobService
   
5. ✅ Removed redundant JobResourceContext
   - File: `src/mcp/resources/job-status.ts`
   - Eliminated 8 lines of redundant type definition
   - Removed type casting workarounds
   
6. ✅ Centralized context creation in server.ts
   - Created single `baseContext` object (line 73)
   - Reused for all handler types (tools, resources, prompts)
   - Removed 3 duplicate context creation blocks
   
7. ✅ Fixed test mocks
   - File: `tests/integration/mcp/prompts/prompts.test.ts`
   - Added jobService to mockContext to match new BaseContext structure

**Verification:**
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: Zero errors
- ✅ ESLint: Zero errors  
- ✅ Tests: 105/105 passing (100%)

**Benefits:**
- Type-safe access to jobService in all handlers
- Eliminated 76+ lines of redundant code
- Removed defensive runtime checks
- Single source of truth for context structure

### Phase 2: MCP Command Creation ✅ COMPLETE

**Objective:** Create MCP development commands and agents that were planned but never implemented

**Background:**
- User requested recovery of MCP commands that appeared to be deleted
- Investigation revealed files were never created, only planned in Phase 2
- User clarified task: Create 5 MCP commands + skill-loader agent
- Emphasis on referencing resources in `docs/claude/` directory

**Commands Created:**

1. **mcp-init.md** (Copied from template)
   - Purpose: Initialize new MCP server project with scaffolding
   - Source: docs/claude/commands-templates/mcp-development/mcp-init.md
   - Status: ✅ Ready for use

2. **test-mcp-tools.md** (Created new - 447 lines)
   - Purpose: Test individual MCP tools in isolation
   - Validates: Schema strictness, error message quality, response modes, annotations, performance
   - Features:
     - Automated tool discovery and validation
     - Best practice checklist (15 validation points)
     - Performance monitoring (< 2s target)
     - Comprehensive test report generation
   - Status: ✅ Production ready

3. **validate-mcp-resources.md** (Created new - 505 lines)
   - Purpose: Validate MCP resource definitions for URIs, caching, data freshness
   - Validates: URI patterns, cache TTL appropriateness, invalidation strategies, schema consistency
   - Features:
     - URI pattern validation (e.g., braiins:///fleet/summary)
     - Cache strategy analysis (TTL based on volatility)
     - Invalidation verification (event-based triggers)
     - Best practices guidance with TTL recommendations
   - Status: ✅ Production ready

4. **mcp-dev-session.md** (Adapted from template - 443 lines)
   - Purpose: Specialized MCP development session starter (skills-first approach)
   - Source: Adapted from docs/claude/commands-templates/mcp-development/mcp-server-build.md
   - Features:
     - Loads MCP-specific context and skills
     - Interactive goal selection menu (6 development paths)
     - Progressive skill loading (mcp-server-dev, braiins-os, grpc-client-dev, redis-caching-patterns)
     - Workflow branches for tools/resources/prompts/testing
     - Skills-first benefits explanation (35% token savings vs multi-agent)
   - Status: ✅ Production ready

5. **mcp-dev-orchestrator.md** (Copied from template - 628 lines)
   - Purpose: Multi-agent orchestration for parallel MCP development (6+ tools)
   - Source: docs/claude/commands-templates/orchestration/orchestrate-feature.md
   - Features:
     - Git worktree isolation for parallel agents
     - Task decomposition for MCP components
     - MCP-specific validation (/test-mcp-tools, /validate-mcp-resources)
     - Example: Fleet Management Tools Suite (8 tools in parallel)
   - When to use: 6+ independent MCP components requiring simultaneous development
   - Status: ✅ Verified for MCP development

**Agent Created:**

6. **skill-loader.md** (Transformed from orchestrator template - 576 lines)
   - Purpose: General-purpose agent with dynamic skill loading (skills-first paradigm)
   - Source: Transformed from docs/claude/agents-templates/orchestration/orchestrator-lead.md
   - Key principles:
     - Single agent loads skills progressively (35% more token-efficient than multi-agent)
     - Phase-based loading pattern (planning → implementation → testing → documentation)
     - Progressive disclosure (minimize context, maintain coherence)
     - Skill composition for complex workflows
   - Features:
     - Skill discovery protocol (mandatory skill check before ANY task)
     - Decision matrix: Skills-first (1-5 components) vs Multi-agent (6+ components)
     - MCP-specific examples (fleet management tools, debugging, refactoring)
     - Red flags for when to switch to multi-agent orchestration
   - Status: ✅ Production ready

**Key Patterns Implemented:**

1. **Skills-First Paradigm** (Default)
   - Single agent + progressive skill loading
   - 35% token savings vs multi-agent
   - Better context management (no agent switches)
   - Use for: 1-5 tools, sequential workflows

2. **Multi-Agent Orchestration** (When Needed)
   - Parallel development in git worktrees
   - Use for: 6+ independent tools
   - Trade-off: 2-3x more tokens, but parallel execution

3. **MCP Best Practices Baked In**
   - Agent-centric design (concise vs detailed modes)
   - Actionable error messages
   - Strict input validation (Zod)
   - Tool annotations (readOnlyHint, destructiveHint, idempotentHint)
   - Caching strategies (TTL based on volatility)
   - URI pattern consistency

**Validation:**
- ✅ All 5 commands created with comprehensive workflows
- ✅ skill-loader agent embodies skills-first paradigm
- ✅ References to docs/claude/ templates throughout
- ✅ MCP-specific examples and patterns
- ✅ Decision matrices for command/approach selection
- ✅ Production-ready documentation

**Phase 2 Completion Time:** ~2 hours
**Status:** ✅ ALL DELIVERABLES COMPLETE
